#1  THE FOLLOWING CODE CALCULATES TOTAL INJURIES
    z=[]
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
         z.append(row.HEAD_INJ + row.CHEST_IN + row.RLEG_INJ + row.LLEG_INJ)
    df['TOT_INJ'] = z
    print(df)


#2  THE FOLLOWING CODE TELLS THAT THERE IS NO RELATION BETWEEN DOORS AND INJURIES

    print(df['DOORS'].corr(df['TOT_INJ']))
    plt.scatter(df['DOORS'],df['TOT_INJ'])
    plt.show()
